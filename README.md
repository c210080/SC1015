## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Commercial Office Rent from [Urban Redevelopment Authority](https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/comm/transaction/search.action).

## Problem Definition

- When a person rent/buy a property, they lack data to help them judge whether itâ€™s an overpricing property or not?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Multi Variants Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Cross Validation

## Conclusion

- Commercia office rent is increasing slowly every year
- There are different categories of office, category 1 higher than category 2
- Most category 1 office are locate at the central area
- There is a need for data resample due to the imbalance data set
- Yes, it is possible to predict the rent 

## What did we learn from this project?

- Using different model to optimase the result
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Linear Regression and Decision Tree from sklearn
- Detail data analysis
